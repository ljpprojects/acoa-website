ACOA1 License

Copyright (c) 2025 ljpprojects

The "Software" refers to the source code, associated documentation, and/or
    any other associated files.

The "Licensee" refers to anyone obtaining a copy, derivative, and/or portion
    of the Software.

"Derivatives" are derivative works.

The "Contributors" are anyone who is acknowledged in the Software itself as
    having made contribution. If this is a Derivative, the
    contributors of the Software it is derived from are also contributors to
    this Derivative.

The "Core Tenets" of ACOA1 are:

    (1) Preventing the intentional restriction of access.

    (2) Allowing successors.

    (3) Allowing multiple included, not effective, licenses.

    (4) Allowing Derivatives to opt-out of an ACOA license in at least one case.

    (5) The inability to remove core tenets, and the ability to add more.

Permission is granted, without charge, to the Licensee, to deal in the Software
without limitation of the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and/or
distribute copies of the Software, provided the following conditions are met
and upheld:

    (1) The ability of others to obtain a copy of the Software is not intentionally
        restricted in any way, whether it may be through mandatory compensation,
        sublicensing the Software to be more restrictive, creating further
        limitation(s) on who can obtain copies of the Software, creating further
        restriction(s) on who can obtain copies of the Software, increasing the
        difficulty of obtaining copies of the Software, or by some other
        means.

    (2) All copies, derivatives and/or portions of the Software must be licensed
        under the ACOA1 license, and the full ACOA1 license must accompany it,
        unless another license is included in the original Software, in which
        case the Licensee may choose which license the derivative, copy,
        and/or portion is licensed under.

    (3) No new trademarks or patents are to be created from the Software, and
        all pre-existing trademarks or patents are used with the correct
        authorisation.

Permission is granted to the Licensee to include any other license with the
Software, even those which have permissions the ACOA1 license lacks, in addition
to the full ACOA1 license. The Software is not licensed under these included
licenses, but the creators of Derivatives may choose to license their derivative
under one of them, as stated above.

Permission is granted to the Licensee to choose to entirely replace the original
ACOA1 license with any of its succesors, provided that if it is a Derivative,
the original also uses the new license. In this case, the terms of the ACOA1
license are voided and replaced with the terms of the chosen succesor. A successor
to the ACOA1 license will explicitly state that it is ACOA1's successor and
keep the Core Tenets of ACOA1. Only Derivatives and copies created after the
switch to the new license are subject to the new license; pre-existing Derivatives,
previous versions of the Software, and pre-obtained copies remain subject to the
old license.
