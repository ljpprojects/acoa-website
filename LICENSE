ACOA1 License

Copyright (c) 2025 ljpprojects

The "Software" refers to the source code, associated documentation, and/or
    any other associated files.

The "Licensee" refers to anyone obtaining a copy, derivative, and/or portion
    of the Software.

"Derivatives" are any copy of the Software which have been meaningfully altered.

"Partial Derivatives" are any portions of the Software which have been meaningfully
    altered.

The "Contributors" are anyone who is acknowledged in the Software itself as
    having made contribution. If this is a Derivative or Partial Derivative, the
    contributors of the Software it is derived from are also contributors to
    this Derivative or Partial Derivative.

Permission is granted, without charge, to the Licensee, to deal in the Software
without limitation of the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and/or
distribute copies of the Software, provided the following conditions are met
and upheld:

    (1) The ability of others to obtain a copy of the Software is not intentionally
        restricted in any way, whether it may be through mandatory compensation,
        sublicensing the Software to be more restrictive, increasing the difficulty
        of obtaining copies of the Software purposefully, and/or by any other means,
        to the extent of the law.

    (2) All copies, derivatives and/or portions of the Software must be licensed under
        the ACOA1 license, and the full ACOA1 license must accompany it, unless another
        license is available in the original Software, in which case the Licensee may
        choose which license the derivative, copy, and/or portion is licensed under.

    (3) The Licensee acknowledges the ability of the law to alter the extent of
        this license, when in conflict with it.

If any of the Contributors hold trademarks, Derivatives and Partial Derivates
may only use them in the Software with express permission from those Contributor
or Contributors who hold the trademark; however, the Licensee is expressly
forbidden to create new trademarks of any Software which is licensed under the
ACOA1 license, to the extent of the law.

If any of the Contributors hold patents, Derivatives and Partial Derivates may
only use them in the Software with express permission from those Contributor or
Contributors who hold the patents; however, the Licensee is expressly forbidden
to create new patents of any Software which is licensed under the ACOA1 license,
to the extent of the law.

Permission is granted to the Licensee to license the Software under any other
license, even those which have permissions the ACOA1 license lacks, in addition
to the full ACOA1 license.

Permission is granted to the Licensee to choose to entirely replace the
original ACOA1 license with any of its succesors. In this case, the terms of
the ACOA1 license are voided and replaced with the terms of the chosen succesor.
A succesor to the ACOA1 license must be authored by the author of the ACOA1
license, and explicitly state that it is ACOA1's successor. Only new Derivatives,
new Partial Derivatives, and newly obtained copies are subject to the new license;
pre-existing Derivatives, Partial Derivatives, and pre-obtained copies remain
subject to the old license.
