            <p>
                The Aggrandised, Convalesced, Open Access License, or ACOA License, is a
                license dedicated to upholding free access, through forbidding
                the restriction of access by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Putting the software behind a paywall or by requiring compensation,</li>
                <li>Sublicensing the Software to a more restrictive license,</li>
                <li>Purposefully increasing the difficulty of obtaining copies of the software, or by</li>
                <li>Any other means.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                The new ACOA2 License offers some much-needed exceptions to the
                anti-restriction clause, and should be used over the ACOA1 license.
            </p>

            <b>
                If you use only the ACOA license, your software and its derivatives should
                remain free of charge to everyone.
            </b>

            <p>
                Others are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and/or
                distribute copies of your software if they follow the conditions
                outlined in the license.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can include mutliple licenses so that anyone who is creating
                a derivative can choose which license to use in their project.
                This allows more flexibility than a copyleft license like GPL.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can re-license software licensed under ACOA licenses to any
                of their succesors freely. This means that if you were to use
                the ACOA2 license today, you can just switch to the ACOA3
                license when it is released, and for anyone who adopted the ACOA1
                license, you can now switch to the ACOA2 license.
            </p>

            <p>
                It contains the same warranty and liability disclaimer as the
                MIT license, so you will get the same protections as if you had
                used the MIT license.
            </p>

ACOA2 License

Copyright (c) [YEAR/YEARS] [NAME]

The "Software" refers to the source code, associated documentation, and/or
    any other associated files.

The "Licensee" refers to anyone obtaining a copy, derivative, and/or portion
    of the Software.

"Derivatives" are derivative works.

The "Contributors" are anyone who is acknowledged in the Software itself as
    having made contribution. If this is a Derivative, the
    contributors of the Software it is derived from are also contributors to
    this Derivative.

The "Core Tenets" of ACOA2 are:

    (1) Preventing the intentional restriction of access.

    (2) Allowing successors.

    (3) Allowing multiple included, not effective, licenses.

    (4) Allowing Derivatives to opt-out of an ACOA license in at least one case.

    (5) The inability to remove core tenets, and the ability to add more.

Acknowledging that ACOA2 is the succesor to ACOA1,

Permission is granted, without charge, to the Licensee, to deal in the Software
without limitation of the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and/or
distribute copies of the Software, provided the following conditions are met
and upheld:

    (1) The ability of others to obtain copies of the Software and to create
        Derivatives based on the Software is not further restrited intentionally,
        in any manner, whether it be by requiring compensation to obtain copies
        of the Software or make Derivatives from the Software, the introduction
        of further restrictions on who is eligible to obtain copies of the
        Software or make Derivatives from the Software, or by any other means,
        unless with the exception of any of the cases described below:

            (a) The Software exposes sensitive information.
                In this case, the Licensee may restrict access to the Software
                to any extent.

            (b) The Software has been replaced by a new version or replacement.
                In this case, the Licensee may restrict access to the Software,
                provided that the new version or replacement takes its place,
                and that others may still obtain copies and create Derivatives
                of the Software.

            (c) The Software was accidentally exposed before it was intended to
                be. In this case, the Licensee may restrict access to the Software,
                but no further than its original restrictions, before it was
                exposed.

    (2) All copies and Derivatives of the Software must be licensed under the
        ACOA2 license, and the full ACOA2 license must accompany it, unless
        another license is included in the original Software, in which case the
        Licensee may choose which license the Derivative or copy is licensed
        under.

    (3) The Software is not licensed under any other license.

Permission is granted to the Licensee to include any other license with the
Software, in addition to the full ACOA2 license. The Software is not and may not
be licensed under these included licenses, but the creators of Derivatives may
choose to license their derivative under one of them, as stated above.

Permission is granted to the Licensee to relicense the Software under a successor
or predecessor of the ACOA2 license. In this case, all terms of the ACOA2 license
are rendered null and void, and are replaced by the terms of the new license.
Any copies or Derivatives of the Software obtained before the new license was
in effect will remain under ACOA2, provided that they were licensed under ACOA2.
You may use the successor or predecessor to the ACOA2 license if and only if the
following criteria are met by the chosen license:

    (1) The Core Tenets are upheld in the chosen license.

    (2) The chosen license explicitly states or acknowledges that it is the succesor
        to ACOA2. If the new license is a predecessor to a newer ACOA license,
        it will and must have a newer ACOA license acknowledge that that newer
        ACOA license is the successor to the chosen license.
