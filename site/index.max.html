                The Access-Central Open Access License, or ACOA License, is a
                license dedicated to upholding free access, through forbidding
                the restriction of access by:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Putting the software behind a paywall or by requiring compensation,</li>
                <li>Sublicensing the Software to a more restrictive license,</li>
                <li>Purposefully increasing the difficulty of obtaining copies of the software, or by</li>
                <li>Any other means.</li>
            </ol>

            <b>
                If you use only the ACOA license, your software and its derivatives should
                remain free of charge to anyone.
            </b>

            <p>
                Others are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and/or
                distribute copies of your software if they follow the conditions
                outlined in the license.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can license the software under mutliple licenses so that
                anyone who is creating a derivative can choose which license to
                use in their project. This allows more flexibility than a
                license like GPL.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can re-license software licensed under ACOA licenses to any
                of their succesors freely. This means that if you were to use
                the ACOA1 license today, you can just switch to the ACOA2
                license when it is released.
            </p>

            <p>
                It contains the same warranty and liability disclaimer as the
                MIT license, so you will get the same protections as if you had
                used the MIT license.
            </p>

Copyright (c) [YEAR/YEARS] [NAME]

The "Software" refers to this software, associated documentation, and/or
    any other associated files.

The "Licensee" refers to anyone obtaining a copy, derivative, and/or portion
    of the Software.

Permission is granted, without charge, to the Licensee, to deal in the Software
without limitation of the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and/or
distribute copies of the Software, provided the following conditions are met
and upheld:

The ability of others to obtain a copy of the Software is not intentionally
restricted in any way, whether it may be through mandatory compensation,
sublicensing the Software to be more restrictive, increasing the difficulty
of obtaining copies of the Software purposefully, and/or by any other means.

All copies, derivatives and/or portions of the Software must be licensed under
the ACOA1 license, and the full ACOA1 license must accompany it, unless another
license is available in the original Software, in which case the Licensee may
choose which license the derivative, copy, and/or portion is licensed under.

Permission is granted to the Licensee to license the Software under any other
license, even those which have permissions the ACOA1 license lacks, in addition
to the full ACOA1 license.

Permission is granted to the Licensee to choose to entirely replace the
original ACOA1 license with any of its succesors. In this case, the terms of
the ACOA1 license are voided and replaced with the terms of the chosen succesor.
A succesor to the ACOA1 license must be authored by the author of the ACOA1
license, and explicitly state that it is ACOA1's successor.
